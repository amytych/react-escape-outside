# React Escape Outside

Higher Order Component to close wrapped component by pressing ESC key or
clicking outside. Combines two separate funcionalities I often find
useful together.

## Usage
`npm i react-escape-outside --save`

```jsx
import EscapeOutside from "react-escape-outside"

<EscapeOutside onEscapeOutside={ this.handleEscapeOutside }>
  <div>Some content that will be closed</div>
</EscapeOutside>
```

Make sure to escape outside from time to time!
